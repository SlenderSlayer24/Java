# Overview

This is the basis of a Mancala game using Java. I like the game mancala and wanted to just get started on the basis of the game. Just getting some of the basic rules down.

# Development Environment

I used Virtual studio code as the main software creation program and the languge is entirly Java. I also used the Array List and Scanner utlities to help aid my program and make it work more like the game.

# Future Work

* I would like to add separate turns as well as incorperate the rules for taking turns multiple times
* Better display of moving peices.
* Just a general graphic out put that will help players better see the game.
